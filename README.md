# COVID-19 Detection Using Deep Learning on Chest X-Ray Images with Flask Deployment 
 - A result of Teamwork

The current COVID-19 diagnosis and testing processes are inefficient, inaccurate, and resource-intensive. Healthcare providers face delays and errors in manual X-ray analysis, hospital administrators struggle with resource shortages and increased patient load, and patients experience anxiety due to slow and sometimes unreliable results. This situation is exacerbated by the pandemic's strain on the healthcare system, leading to frustration, stress, and uncertainty among all involved parties.

In this project, four advanced deep learning models—InceptionV3, VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception—were trained and evaluated on chest X-ray images to detect COVID-19. All models demonstrated high classification accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of transfer learning in medical image analysis.

# InceptionV3 
- achieved the highest accuracy of 99.96%, making it the most reliable model for COVID-19 detection among the tested architectures.

# VGG16 and ResNet50 
- Both the models gives an impressive accuracy of 99.77%, showing robust and consistent performance.

# Xception
- The model gives slightly lower but still performed well with an accuracy of 98.9%, proving itself a viable option with a lighter computational footprint.
